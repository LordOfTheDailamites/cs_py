# CSPy

**Disclaimer:** I was not educated in computer science, nor do I have enough knowledge of GitHub and how all the fork and open collaboration shenanigans work. I am an electrical engineering student who happens to be coding, not because I enjoy it but only because my research requires me to do so. The reason I am putting this work in a GitHub repo is so that I can reach out to people for improvisation. I want this project to be actually useful for the people working on CS. If the format of the files looks crude to you, or you can come up with improvisations and better implementations, or if you have bigger and better ideas, or even if you want to show me some tutorials on better coding practices and GitHub use, I would appreciate all the feedback and help.

A collection of methods and implementations of CS algorithms on Python with NumPy.

The codework aims to apply compressive sensing (CS) methods and related objects at a low level. The aim is to have the source code files for understanding the implementation of the mathematical concepts. People who are working on the same topic can find and use the resources here or add their codeword. 

The final goal is to have as many resources and implementations of the available methods as possible, with proper documentation in PDF format accompanying the .py files.

# CSPy

**Disclaimer:** I was not educated in computer science, nor do I have enough knowledge of GitHub and how all the fork and open collaboration shenanigans work. I am an electrical engineering student who happens to be coding not because I enjoy it but only because my research requires me to do so, and the reason I am putting them to a GitHub repo is so that I can reach out to people for help. If the format of the files looks crude to you, or you can come up with improvisations and better implementations, or if you have bigger and better ideas about the topic, or even if you want to show me some tutorials on better coding practices and GitHub use, I would appreciate all the feedback and help.

A collection of methods and implementations of CS algorithms on Python with NumPy.

The codework aims to apply compressive sensing (CS) methods and related objects at a low level. The aim is to have the source code files for understanding the implementation of the mathematical concepts. The students that are working on the same topic can find and use the resources here, or add their own codework.

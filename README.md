# CSPy

**Disclaimer:** I was not educated in computer science, nor do I have enough knowledge of GitHub. I am an electrical engineering student who happens to be coding only because my research requires me to do so. If the format of the files looks crude to you, or you can come up with improvisations and better implementations, or if you have bigger and better ideas about the topic, or even if you want to show me some tutorials on better coding practices, I would appreciate all the feedback and help.

A collection of methods and implementations of CS algorithms on Python with NumPy.

The codework aims to apply compressive sensing (CS) methods and related objects (such as bases) at a low level.

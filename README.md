# CSPy

A collection of methods and implementations of compressive sensing (CS) algorithms on Python with NumPy.

**Disclaimer:** I was not educated in computer science, nor do I have enough knowledge of GitHub. I am an electrical engineering student who happens to be coding, not because I enjoy it but because my research requires me to do so. I want this repo to be actually helpful for the people working on compressive sensing. The reason I am putting this work in a GitHub repo is so that I can reach out to people who work on a CS-related project. If the format of the files looks crude to you, or you can come up with improvements and better implementations, or if you have bigger and better ideas, or even if you want to show me some tutorials on better coding practices and GitHub use, I would appreciate all the feedback and help.

The codework aims to apply CS methods and related objects at a low level. The aim is to have the source code files for understanding the implementation of the mathematical concepts. People working on the same topic can find and use the resources here or add their own codeword.

The final goal is to have as many resources and implementations of the available methods as possible, with proper documentation in PDF format accompanying the .py files.
